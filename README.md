The WIP beginnings of a vulkan renderer. A mostly complete implementation of the Vulkan tutorial, https://vulkan-tutorial.com/, in Rust using Vulkano, https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano.

Currently supports loading the chalet model from the vulkan tutorial and a free flying camera.
Controls:
	WASD to move.
	Mouse to look around.
	ESC to pause/resume.
