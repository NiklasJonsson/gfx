Currently, the matrial color is a uniform. This means it is uniform per-drawcall but the color is
not uniform per chunk, each block should have its own color.

1. Get current way of rendering to work with single uniform color.
  * There are probably bugs here
2. Associate color with each block
  * Each block in a chunk should have a color
  * Vertex color?
  * Go with block type instead and make it a lookup thing in the shader?    
  * Block-type and shader atlas? IIRC, this is the minecraft way
3. Re-read John-Lis blog on voxel engine
